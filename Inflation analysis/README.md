# Global Inflation Rate Analysis (1960-2023)

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes global inflation trends from 1960 to 2023 using World Bank data. It includes data cleaning, visualization, trend analysis, and predictive modeling using ARIMA.

## Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Time Series Analysis (Statsmodels, ARIMA)  

## Dataset  
- Source: [World Bank CPI Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG)  
- Contains inflation rates for 266 countries (1960-2023)  

## Key Features  
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Visualizing inflation trends with line charts, bar charts, and box plots  
- Moving averages and rolling mean analysis  
- ARIMA-based forecasting for future inflation trends  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inflation-analysis.git
   cd inflation-analysis
   ```
2. Open `Inflation.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run all cells to explore the analysis.  

## Future Improvements  
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash  
- Comparison of inflation trends with GDP growth  
- More advanced forecasting models (LSTMs)  

## License  
This project is open-source and free to use for educational purposes.
